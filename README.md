# BufferOverflow_explained

This is my attempt at explaining step-by-step on how to exploit Buffer Overflow Machines. My aim is to get students like me comfortable with exploiting Buffer Overflow Machines before attempting their OSCP or eCPPT exams and passing in their first try. Enjoy and please share it if you found it helpful :)


Contents:

1- FTPServer.exe ---> You will need this executable file on your windows XP machine so you can complete the exercise.

2- Buffer_FTP.py ---> This is a python script I used to complete the exercise. You can use your own python script if you like or you can use this one. It's up to you :)

3- Buffer Overflow.pdf ---> This includes my humble step-by-step guide on how to exploit the BOF machine.

4- BOF.rar ---> This includes all the files above, including a separate file that has all the pictures I've included in my guide.

Good Luck.
